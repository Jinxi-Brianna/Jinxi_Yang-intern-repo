## Reflection – Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

### 1. What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?
I will use a laptop stand to raise my screen to eye level, which will reduce neck strain. I will also connect an external keyboard and mouse so my wrists and arms can stay in a neutral position. Additionally, I will adjust my chair height so that my feet rest flat on the floor and my knees are at a comfortable 90-degree angle.

### 2. What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?
I will sit upright with my shoulders relaxed and my lower back supported, avoiding slouching forward. I will take short standing or stretching breaks every 30–60 minutes to relieve tension in my neck, shoulders, and back. I will also adjust my screen height and distance to maintain a comfortable viewing position that reduces eye strain.

### 3. How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?
I will use Focus Bear to schedule regular movement and posture reminders throughout the day. I will also keep a sticky note near my monitor as a visual cue to sit upright and relax my shoulders. Whenever I return to my desk, I will quickly reset my posture before starting work.

### Document – Workspace Change / Habit Adjustment
I have started using a laptop stand and an external keyboard to keep my screen at eye level and my wrists in a neutral position. I also set regular Focus Bear movement reminders to ensure I take breaks and reset my posture throughout the day.
