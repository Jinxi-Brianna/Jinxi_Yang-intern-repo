## Reflection

### 1. How can Focus Bear maintain a minimal, distraction-free UI while still offering powerful features?
Focus Bear can keep the interface minimal by prioritizing the most important actions on each screen and hiding secondary options until they’re needed. Features that are useful but not always necessary can be placed behind expandable menus or “Advanced Settings” sections. This ensures that during focus or break sessions, only essential elements — like the task name, timer, and a single action button — are visible, while advanced tools remain accessible without cluttering the main experience.

### 2. If a design change improves aesthetics but reduces usability, how should UX handle it?
UX should always prioritize usability over purely visual improvements, especially for neurodivergent users who benefit from clarity and predictability. If an aesthetic update makes it harder to find actions or understand status, the design should be revised or rolled back. Ideally, the team can look for alternative solutions that maintain the improved look without sacrificing ease of use — for example, keeping a cleaner visual style while ensuring buttons remain highly visible and labeled.

### 3. What are the risks of overloading users with too many choices or settings?
Offering too many options can increase cognitive load, slow down decision-making, and cause users to abandon tasks. For neurodivergent users, excess settings can create confusion and reduce engagement. In Focus Bear, this could mean users spend more time configuring break routines or focus rules than actually using the app. To avoid this, settings should be grouped logically, have sensible defaults, and be introduced gradually, so users can customize at their own pace without feeling overwhelmed.
