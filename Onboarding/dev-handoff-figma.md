## Overview
This delivery includes two screens in the onboarding flow:
1. **Selection** – User decides whether to enable a tech curfew.
2. **Time Setting** – If "Yes" is selected, the user chooses the time to get off tech in the evening.

## Components
- Primary button: "Continue"
- Dialogue buttons: "Yes" and "No, thanks"
- Time picker for curfew selection

## Interaction Notes
- When the user selects **Yes**, the screen transitions to the time picker.
- When the user selects **No, thanks**, the flow skips this step and continues.
- The curfew description text clarifies that Focus Bear blocks distracting apps before bedtime.
- No animation or advanced motion required.

## Style
- Font and colours follow existing app design tokens.
- Layout and alignment consistent with other onboarding steps.
