What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

Current Security Measures I Follow
1.	Use strong, unique passwords: This prevents attackers from guessing or reusing stolen passwords.
2.	Store passwords in a password manager: It keeps them secure and avoids reuse across accounts.
3.	Enable Two Factor Authentication (2FA) on key accounts: Adds an extra layer of protection beyond passwords.
4.	Lock my computer when away: Stops anyone nearby from accessing sensitive data.
5.	Stay alert to phishing attempts: Avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading unsafe attachments.
Areas for Improvement
1.	Enable 2FA on all accounts: Extends strong authentication to every service I use.
2.	Improve phishing detection skills: Helps identify more sophisticated phishing attacks.
3.	Be cautious on public Wi Fi: Avoid data interception; consider using a VPN in the future.
4.	Conduct regular account audits: Remove unused accounts and limit unnecessary permissions.
5.	Encrypt sensitive local files: Protects important data even if my device is lost or stolen.
6.	Regular software updates for OS, browsers, and work tools: Ensures known security vulnerabilities are patched promptly.
7.	Enable auto lock on devices – Ensures devices lock automatically after inactivity to prevent unauthorised access

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

• Integrate security into daily routines – Treat actions like locking your computer, verifying links, and enabling 2FA as part of your normal workflow, not optional steps.
• Automate where possible – Use password managers, auto lock settings, and automatic software updates so security doesn’t rely on memory alone.
• Set reminders and checkpoints – Schedule periodic reviews to check account security, update passwords, and audit permissions.
• Stay informed – Keep up to date on common threats and new best practices so secure behaviour stays relevant and top of mind.
• Link habits to clear consequences – Remember that skipping a step (like locking your computer) can directly lead to data breaches, helping reinforce why security matters.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

1. Use strong, unique passwords for each account – Avoids password reuse and makes it harder for attackers to guess.
2. Store passwords in a password manager – Keeps them encrypted and reduces the need to remember or write them down.
3. Enable Two‑Factor Authentication (2FA) wherever possible – Adds an extra security layer beyond just a password.
4. Change passwords immediately if a breach is suspected – Prevents attackers from continuing to access compromised accounts.
5. Avoid sharing passwords with others – Reduces the risk of accidental leaks or intentional misuse.
6. Regularly review and update account credentials – Ensures outdated or weak passwords are replaced with stronger ones.

What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

• Immediately change my password – Prevents further unauthorised access.
• Enable or review Two Factor Authentication (2FA) – Adds an extra layer of security if not already active.
• Log out of all active sessions – Forces any unauthorised users to be disconnected.
• Check account activity logs – Identifies suspicious logins, device access, or changes.
• Notify the relevant IT or security team – Ensures the incident is investigated and handled properly.
• Scan my devices for malware – Removes any malicious software that may have caused the breach.
• Monitor accounts for unusual activity – Keeps watch for further suspicious behaviour or fraud.
