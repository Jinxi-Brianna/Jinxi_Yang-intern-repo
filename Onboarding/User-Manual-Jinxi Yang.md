# User Manual for Me

## My Role
I am a **UX Designer Intern** at Focus Bear, working on:
- Redesigning the Focus Bear app to enhance usability and user experience  
- Creating wireframes and interactive prototypes in Figma  
- Conducting user testing, gathering feedback, and refining designs  
- Collaborating with product managers and developers to align design with technical requirements  
- Improving app accessibility and ensuring inclusive design for neurodivergent users  

This internship is a hands-on role where I work closely with the product and engineering teams to bring design ideas to life. My work focuses on applying UX principles to solve real user problems and delivering designs that balance user needs with technical constraints.

## The Days and Times I Work Are

## How I Work Best
I do my best work when:
- I have clear goals, priorities, and deadlines  
- I understand the context and purpose of the task  
- I have uninterrupted focus time  
- Feedback is provided early and specifically  

I struggle when:
- Instructions are vague or lack context  
- I’m interrupted frequently during focus time  
- Priorities change suddenly without explanation  

Quirks or things to know about my work style:
- I’m comfortable with most communication formats, but I prefer information and feedback to be presented in **written form** whenever possible. This helps me process ideas clearly and refer back to them later.

## Communication Style
I prefer messages to be:
- Clear, concise, and specific  
- With relevant context before details  
- Supported by visuals (screenshots, examples) when possible  

The best way to reach me is:
- **Non-urgent tasks:** Email or Discord  
- **Discussions requiring input:** Scheduled calls or meetings  

If you need something urgent, do this:
- Send me an **email** — I check my email frequently and respond quickly  

---

## Collaboration & Teamwork
I work best in a team when:
- Everyone shares progress openly and meets deadlines  
- Communication is respectful and constructive  
- We collaborate on ideas before finalising decisions  

My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is:
- Unclear expectations or lack of ownership  

If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means:
- I’m processing information or thinking through ideas  

---

## Focus & Productivity
I stay focused by:
- Blocking out time for design work  
- Using task lists to track priorities  

Things that distract me:
- Unscheduled calls or last-minute changes  

The best way to support my productivity is:
- Provide clear task briefs with deadlines  
- Give me enough uninterrupted time to work deeply  

---

## Feedback & Growth
I like feedback to be:
- Direct but respectful  
- Specific and supported by examples  
- Given early enough for me to adjust  

When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is:
- Send me a private message or email with details and suggestions for improvement  

I appreciate it when teammates:
- Share constructive feedback  
- Offer new ideas and alternative perspectives

## Fun Facts & Quirks
One thing people often misunderstand about me is:
- If I’m focused and quiet, it doesn’t mean I’m disengaged — I’m just in deep thinking mode  

A fun fact about me:
- I am often more productive when working while listening to music or having a TV show playing in the background  

My work superpower is:
- Translating abstract ideas into clear, actionable wireframes and flows
