# Reflection: Focus Bear vs. Competitors

## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear is unique because it combines app/site blocking, structured routines, and neurodiversity-friendly design in one platform. Unlike competitors that specialize in only one aspect (e.g., Freedom focuses on blocking, Routinery focuses on routines), Focus Bear supports users through the entire workday — from guiding their morning routine to helping them avoid distractions during deep work.

Its playful, supportive UI and structured routine flow make it especially helpful for users with ADHD or those looking for more than just a to-do list or a blocker.

## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I would choose Focus Bear if I needed structure, focus, and gentle guidance all in one place — without having to juggle multiple tools. It doesn’t just block distractions; it helps build routines and encourages mindful breaks, making it easier to stay on track.

It’s also designed with neurodivergent users in mind, which sets it apart from more rigid or generic productivity apps.

## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
While Focus Bear supports cross-platform functionality and offers distraction blocking, it currently lacks some key features found in other apps, such as:

- **Insight** – analytics showing how much time you spend on each site  
- **Limit** – daily time caps for specific websites or categories  
- **Planner** – a visual way to schedule tasks or routines in a timeline or calendar format  

Apps like Freedom help users become more aware of their habits through data, while Tiimo allows users to plan their day in advance using a clear visual schedule. These features help users build better habits and feel more organized — areas where Focus Bear still has room to grow.

**Personal experience:**  
When I tested Tiimo on my phone, I tried scheduling my afternoon work session using its timeline view. The drag-and-drop blocks made it easy to see exactly when each task would happen, and the gentle notifications kept me aware of upcoming transitions. It felt very visual and structured — something I immediately missed when I switched back to Focus Bear. This reinforced the value of having a built-in daily planner.

## Based on your research, what’s one improvement Focus Bear could make?
One improvement Focus Bear could make is to add a daily or weekly planning feature. While it helps users stay focused during the day through routines, it doesn’t currently offer a way to visually plan ahead or organize tasks across a full day or week.

In comparison, Tiimo provides a timeline-based planner that allows users to schedule tasks and see how their day is structured. A similar feature in Focus Bear — even something simple like a drag-and-drop planner — would help users better manage their time, prepare in advance, and reduce mental load.
