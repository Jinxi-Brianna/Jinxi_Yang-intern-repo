## 1. Participant Question Responses

**1. How easy or difficult was it to start the Focus Session?**  
It was relatively easy to start a Focus Session — both the “Start a focus session” button on the Habits page and the Focus tab lead to the same setup screen. However, having two identical entry points feels redundant and slightly unnecessary.  

Rita said: “Oh, there are two start buttons… aren’t they doing the same thing? That feels a bit unnecessary.”

**2. Was anything unclear or confusing during the process?**  
Yes — once the Focus Session started, I couldn’t edit the Focus Goal, which was unexpected. Also, the two-step flow (time setup screen → separate countdown screen) felt unnecessarily long.  
The “Edit Time” label was also misleading — I initially thought it meant resetting the total session length, but it actually extends the session.

Rita said, “Wait, I can’t change my focus goal now? I thought I could still add it after starting.”

About the label: “‘Edit Time’ sounds like I can reset it to 25 minutes, but it actually just keeps adding more time. That’s confusing.”

**3. Did you notice any labels, icons, or buttons that were hard to understand?**  
The “Focus Goal” field could be more clearly explained — it’s not obvious if it’s required or optional. The end-session flow also wasn’t immediately clear, as it required selecting a reason for ending.

Rita said: “Is the Focus Goal optional? I’m not sure if I have to type something here.”
About ending: “Why do I need to pick a reason just to stop? I just want to finish quickly.”

**4. If you could change one thing about the Focus Session setup, what would it be?**  
I would merge the time setup and countdown into one screen with a default 25-minute option, and allow quick adjustments via a wheel or slider. I would also simplify ending a session (e.g., long-press to pause, then choose “Complete” or “Break”).  
Rename or redesign the “Edit Time” feature to clearly indicate extension (e.g., ‘Extend +’).

Rita said: “I’d prefer if it just started right away with 25 minutes, and I could adjust it on the same screen instead of going through two steps.”

**5. On a scale from 0–10, how would you rate the overall usability of this feature? Why?**  
6/10 – The basic flow is functional, but redundancy and extra steps reduce efficiency.

Rita said: “It works, but it feels slower than it should be. I’d give it a six.”

## 2. Observation Log – Focus Session Test

| Step / Interaction     | User Action                                    | Observation / Quotes                                                                 | Pain Points / Suggestions                                                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Entry to Focus Session | Used both entry points (Habits page & Focus tab) | Rita: *“These two buttons do the same thing, why not just one?”*                      | Feels redundant; consider keeping one clear entry path                                    |
| Setting Focus Goal     | Tried to add/edit goal after starting           | Rita: *“Oh, I can’t edit my goal now? That’s annoying.”*                              | Allow editing goal during session                                                         |
| Starting the Timer     | Went through two screens (time setup → countdown) | Rita: *“Feels like an extra step. Can’t I just start right away?”*                    | Combine into one screen with default 25 min and quick adjust option                       |
| Ending a Session       | Pressed End → prompted to select a reason        | Rita: *“Why do I need to pick a reason? I just want to stop.”*                        | Simplify stop interaction (e.g., long-press to pause, then choose Complete/Break)         |
| Editing Time           | Tried to reset timer to 25 minutes mid-session   | Rita: *“I thought ‘Edit Time’ meant change it back, but it just added more minutes.”* | Rename to “Extend” and provide clear feedback (e.g., *Extended +10 min, total 35*)        |

## 3.Summary & Recommendation
Based on the observations and participant feedback, it is recommended to redesign the Focus Session interface in the Focus Bear iPhone app to improve efficiency, flexibility, and clarity.  

Key opportunities for redesign include:  
1. Consolidate the two identical entry points into a single, clear starting path.  
2. Make the Focus Goal field more visible and allow adding or editing it during an active session.  
3. Merge the time setup and countdown into a single screen with a default time option and quick adjustment controls.  
4. Introduce a flexible pause option to temporarily stop a session without fully ending it.  
5. Clarify time adjustment: Replace the misleading “Edit Time” label with “Extend” (or a + icon next to the timer), and provide clear feedback when time is extended. 


## 4. Reflection

**What surprised you the most about how your test participant used the app?**  
What surprised me most was how quickly Rita noticed the redundancy between the two entry points. I hadn’t thought much about it before, but she immediately asked, *“Why are there two start buttons if they do the same thing?”* It reminded me that users can be very sensitive to unnecessary complexity, even if it doesn’t block them from completing the task.  

**Did they encounter any issues that you didn’t expect?**  
Yes — I didn’t expect the inability to edit the Focus Goal after starting the session to feel so restrictive. Rita seemed genuinely frustrated, saying she wanted to adjust it once she had started focusing. I also assumed the two-step transition (time setup → countdown) might feel normal, but she found it clunky. That reaction made me realise that what feels “standard” to a designer isn’t always the smoothest for a user.  

**How could this test improve your approach to UX design?**  
This test really highlighted the importance of *efficiency* in user flows. I used to focus mainly on clarity — making sure people understood what each button did — but now I see that reducing unnecessary steps is just as important. In future designs, I’ll pay closer attention to whether tasks can be completed in fewer interactions, and I’ll make sure that key elements (like editing a goal) remain flexible during use. I also want to encourage participants to talk out loud more during testing, since hearing their instant reactions helped me understand their mindset much better.
