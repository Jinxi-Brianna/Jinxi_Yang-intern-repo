## Reflection

### 1. If a user struggles with a feature during testing, how do you know if it’s a UX problem or a learning curve issue?
To determine whether the difficulty is a UX problem or simply a learning curve issue, you need to observe how quickly the user improves after initial exposure and whether the problem repeats across multiple participants. If most users behave the same way — for example, they see the feature but don’t use it because they don’t understand its value — that points to a UX issue related to communication, not just unfamiliarity. In Focus Bear, if several users notice the “Brain Dump” button but choose not to use it because they don’t realise it can later feed into an AI-generated plan, that’s a sign the feature’s purpose needs to be made clearer.

### 2. How can UX designers ensure they don’t influence user responses during an interview?
UX designers can avoid influencing responses by using neutral, open-ended questions, avoiding leading language, and keeping body language neutral. Instead of asking, “Do you find this onboarding flow easy to use?”, they can ask, “How did you find the onboarding process?” or “What, if anything, was confusing?” They should also avoid nodding, smiling, or showing approval when a user gives a certain type of answer, as this can subconsciously encourage similar responses. In Focus Bear’s context, if a participant says, “I skipped this step,” the designer should ask, “What made you decide to skip it?” instead of explaining the intended use.

### 3. What’s the best way to document usability testing results so they are useful for design decisions?
The best way is to combine structured notes with recordings or screenshots, so observations are both clear and verifiable. Notes should be organized by task, including:

- What the user did (observed behavior)  
- What they said (verbatim quotes)  
- Where they struggled (pain points)  
- Severity and frequency of issues  
- Potential design implications  

Tagging issues with priority levels (e.g., High/Medium/Low) helps the design team decide what to fix first. In Focus Bear, documenting that “4 out of 5 users did not notice the break reminder button in focus mode” along with a screenshot of the current design gives clear, actionable evidence for redesign.
