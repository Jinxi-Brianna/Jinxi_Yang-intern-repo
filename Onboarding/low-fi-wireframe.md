# Reflection

### 1. How can low-fidelity wireframes help avoid costly design mistakes?  
Low-fidelity wireframes make it easy to test structure, flow, and content placement early. Because they are quick and cheap to modify, teams can identify usability issues before investing in high-fidelity designs, reducing the risk of expensive rework later.

### 2. If a stakeholder wants to jump straight into high-fidelity design, how would you explain the value of low-fi wireframing?  
I would explain that low-fi wireframes save time and resources by focusing on layout and flow first. They help the team reach alignment faster, prevent distractions from visual details, and allow more iterations. Skipping this step often leads to overlooked usability issues that are harder and costlier to fix in polished designs.

### 3. What are some common mistakes designers make when creating wireframes?  
- Adding too much visual detail, which distracts from structure and flow.  
- Skipping user feedback and treating wireframes as final.  
- Overcomplicating layouts instead of keeping them simple.  
- Ignoring consistency in navigation and interactions.
