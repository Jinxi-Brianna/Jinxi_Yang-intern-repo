## Reflection

**1. What usability issues can a clickable prototype reveal that a static wireframe cannot?**  
A clickable prototype can uncover navigation and interaction problems that a static wireframe cannot show. For example, it can reveal whether users understand which elements are clickable, whether the flow between screens is logical, and if users encounter confusion or dead ends when completing tasks. These issues only appear when the design is experienced interactively.  

**2. How can prototyping help designers communicate ideas more clearly to developers?**  
Prototyping provides a visual and interactive representation of the intended design, making it easier for developers to understand the logic and flow without relying solely on documentation. Instead of interpreting static screens, developers can follow the prototype step by step, which reduces miscommunication and clarifies expected behaviors such as transitions, overlays, and button states.  

**3. What are common mistakes designers make when creating prototypes?**  
Common mistakes include focusing too much on visual detail at an early stage instead of validating the flow, forgetting to connect important interactions that break the user journey, and ignoring alternative paths or edge cases. Another frequent issue is creating overly complex prototypes that are difficult to test and maintain, which can reduce their effectiveness in usability testing.
