## Reflection: Creating a High-Fidelity Prototype

### Q1. How can a high-fidelity prototype help developers build the final product accurately?

A high-fidelity prototype helps developers build the final product accurately by providing clear and detailed design specifications. Developers can view the exact color values, typography, spacing, and animation timing directly in Figma, which reduces misunderstanding and guesswork. It also allows them to see realistic user flows and interactions, so they can better understand how each screen connects and how the system should respond. In this way, the prototype becomes a shared reference that aligns the design team and the development team, improving efficiency and ensuring that the final product reflects the intended design.

### Q2. What are the risks of focusing too much on visuals before usability is validated?

Focusing too much on visuals before validating usability can create a product that looks appealing but is difficult to use. When designers spend too much time perfecting colors and layouts before confirming that users can complete key tasks, they risk wasting resources on elements that do not improve usability. This can delay user testing and make later adjustments more costly. Overemphasis on visuals may also hide structural issues such as unclear navigation or poor information hierarchy. Therefore, it is important to confirm usability first and then refine the visual design to ensure that aesthetics support function rather than replace it.

### Q3. How can small details like button states, hover effects, and transitions improve the user experience?

Small details such as button states, hover effects, and transitions improve user experience by providing clear feedback and creating a sense of responsiveness. These elements help users understand that their actions have been recognised, for example when a button changes color after being clicked. Smooth transitions between pages also help maintain continuity and reduce cognitive load, making the interface feel more natural. Although these details are subtle, they build user trust and make the product feel polished and human-centered.
