# Design Kickoff Summary - Onboarding / Time Setting Redesign

## Overview
A short internal design kickoff was completed for the Time Setting redesign.  
The goal was to confirm that the new layout, flow, and copy are fully documented for implementation.

## Discussion Points
- The old popup layout was replaced with a full-screen version to maintain consistency across onboarding.  
- The new flow contains two screens:
  1. Tech Curfew Selection  
  2. Time Picker  
- The interaction is direct: selecting “Yes” opens the time picker, selecting “No thanks” skips the step.  
- Copy and tone remain conversational and aligned with the app’s style.  
- All components reuse existing design tokens and buttons.

## Notes
- The flow is technically simple and requires no new components.  
- All annotations and navigation logic are now documented in Figma.  
- QA will later verify the transitions and button behavior.

## Outcome
The kickoff ensured that the redesign goals and logic were clearly documented.  
The file is developer-ready, with consistent structure, reusable elements, and clear interaction notes.
