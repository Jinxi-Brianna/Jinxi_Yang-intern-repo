## Reflection

### 1. If Focus Bear wanted to improve its onboarding experience, which UX research methods would be most useful?
To improve onboarding, the most useful approach would be a combination of **usability testing** and **self-reported feedback**. Usability testing would allow the UX team to observe how new users navigate the onboarding flow in real time — where they hesitate, what steps they skip, and whether they understand key features like focus sessions and break reminders. This reveals issues users may not be aware of or able to articulate. Self-reported feedback, such as post-onboarding surveys or short interviews, can then capture their subjective impressions, such as whether the instructions felt clear, if the amount of information was manageable, and if they felt ready to start using the app. Using both methods ensures the team gets both behavioral evidence and emotional context, making it easier to prioritize changes that improve clarity and reduce overwhelm.

### 2. What challenges might arise when collecting self-reported user feedback?
Self-reported feedback can be affected by several factors. Users may give **inaccurate responses** due to poor memory (forgetting details of their experience) or **social desirability bias** (saying what they think the researcher wants to hear). Some users, especially those with ADHD, might not recall the exact points where they felt confused during onboarding. Others might focus on the most recent part of their experience, ignoring earlier pain points. There’s also a risk of **low specificity** — vague comments like “It was fine” provide little actionable insight. To address these challenges, questions should be concrete and specific (e.g., “Was there any step that felt unclear?”) and be asked soon after the experience to improve accuracy.

### 3. How can UX designers avoid bias when conducting research?
To avoid bias, UX designers should use **neutral, open-ended questions**, avoid leading language, and ensure that participants feel comfortable giving honest answers. For example, instead of asking, “Did you like the new onboarding design?”, they might ask, “How did you feel about the onboarding process?” or “What, if anything, would you change?” Designers should also be aware of **confirmation bias** — the tendency to look for feedback that supports their existing assumptions — and make sure to document both positive and negative findings. In Focus Bear’s case, this might mean actively recruiting a mix of neurodivergent and neurotypical participants, ensuring feedback reflects a broad range of needs rather than a narrow user segment.
