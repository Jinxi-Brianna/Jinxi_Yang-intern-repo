## Reflection

### 1. If a new feature looks visually appealing but is hard to use, how should UX designers handle that tradeoff?

UX designers should prioritize usability over aesthetics, especially since Focus Bear’s target users, many of whom are neurodivergent, rely on clarity and predictability to stay engaged. If a visually appealing feature creates confusion, slows task completion, or increases cognitive load, it should be revised to improve usability. In some cases, the design can be adjusted to preserve visual appeal while making interactions clearer, such as increasing contrast, simplifying layouts, or adding descriptive labels without losing the overall style.

### 2. What specific challenges might neurodivergent users face when using productivity apps?

Neurodivergent users may struggle with complex navigation, cluttered interfaces, and too many customization options at once. ADHD users can lose focus if there are too many distractions, notifications, or steps required to complete an action. Autistic users may find inconsistent layouts or unpredictable behaviors stressful and may be sensitive to overly bright colors, rapid animations, or unexpected sounds. These challenges can lead to frustration, abandonment of the app, and reduced long-term engagement if not addressed in UX design.

In fact, I have seen this firsthand when my friend, who has ADHD, tried using a habit tracker app that required multiple steps just to log one simple task. The app had flashy animations, scattered icons, and unclear progress indicators. She quickly gave up after a few attempts because it felt mentally exhausting and hard to navigate. If the app had offered a calmer interface, fewer required actions, and a clearer routine structure, she might have stuck with it longer. This experience helped me realise how easily intention can be disrupted by poor UX for users who rely on mental energy to stay organised.

### 3. How can Focus Bear's UX differentiate itself from other productivity tools?

Focus Bear’s UX can stand out by being purpose-built for neurodivergent users rather than retrofitting general productivity app patterns. This means maintaining a minimal, distraction-free interface during focus sessions, offering clear time indicators, and using predictable navigation across all features. It can also integrate features like smart break reminders, hyperfocus detection, and gradual habit-building workflows, all presented in a way that avoids overwhelming the user. By combining accessibility, clarity, and a deep understanding of neurodivergent needs, Focus Bear can offer an experience that feels supportive rather than demanding.
