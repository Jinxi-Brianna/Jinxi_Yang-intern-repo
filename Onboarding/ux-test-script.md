# Usability Test Script – Focus Bear (iPhone) – Focus Session

## 1. Introduction
Thank you for participating in this usability test.  
Today, we are evaluating the **Focus Session** feature in the Focus Bear iPhone app.  
This is not a test of you — it’s a test of the app’s design and usability, so there are no right or wrong answers.  

As you go through the task, please **think aloud**: share what you see, what you expect to happen, and why you take each action.  
If you encounter difficulties, I may ask clarifying questions to better understand your thought process, but I won’t guide you to the answer unless necessary.

## 2. Scenario
Imagine you have just downloaded the Focus Bear app on your iPhone.  
Your goal is to **set up and start a Focus Session for 25 minutes**.  
Begin wherever you think makes sense — either from the Habits page or the Focus tab — and work your way through until the timer starts.
