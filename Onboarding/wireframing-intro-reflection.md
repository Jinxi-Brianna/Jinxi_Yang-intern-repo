## Reflection

1. **What are the benefits of starting with wireframes rather than jumping into high-fidelity design?**  
   Starting with wireframes saves time and resources by allowing designers to validate layout and information architecture before investing effort into polished visuals. Wireframes are quick to create, easy to iterate on, and make it easier to gather feedback early. They also help the team focus on functionality and user flows first, without being distracted by colors, fonts, or other visual details. This reduces the risk of costly rework and ensures the design direction aligns with business goals and user needs from the start.

2. **How can wireframes help identify usability issues early?**  
   Wireframes clearly show the structure and interaction paths of an interface, enabling teams and users to spot potential problems early — such as unclear navigation, poor information hierarchy, or difficulty locating key features. Because wireframes strip away visual styling, reviewers can focus on usability and functionality, making it easier to identify process bottlenecks or logic gaps before they escalate in later design stages.

3. **If a stakeholder asks for a high-fidelity design too soon, how would you explain the value of wireframing?**  
   I would explain that while high-fidelity designs look appealing, they take more time to produce and are more costly to change. Jumping to high-fidelity before requirements are fully understood increases the risk of major rework. Wireframes provide a way to quickly test and confirm structure and flow, so that when the team moves to high-fidelity, the process is faster and more targeted. For example, in Focus Bear’s case, going straight to high-fidelity might result in spending significant time polishing visuals, only to later discover that the main feature entry point is poorly placed — forcing a full redesign.
