## Reflection: When Should You Use AI for Assistance, and When Should You Rely on Your Own Skills?

### 1. When to Use AI for Assistance
- Speeding up repetitive tasks: summarising research notes, drafting initial design copy, generating brainstorming ideas.  
- Exploring new perspectives: asking AI for alternative design patterns or user flow suggestions when stuck.  
- Information gathering: quickly outlining possible solutions before doing in-depth validation.  

### 2. When to Rely on My Own Skills
- Final decision-making: AI can provide input, but final UX decisions must be based on my design judgment, project context, and user needs.  
- Sensitive or confidential work: Avoid using AI for projects involving private company data or sensitive client information.  
- Creative and empathetic design: AI can’t fully replace human empathy and deep understanding of user context, which are essential in UX design.  

### 3. My Personal Approach
I see AI as a supporting tool, not a replacement for my skills. I will use it to speed up research, generate ideas, and organise information, but I will always validate outputs and apply my own design thinking to ensure quality and relevance.

## How Can You Avoid Over-Reliance on AI While Still Benefiting from It?

1. Use AI as a Starting Point, Not the Final Answer  
   Treat AI outputs as drafts or inspiration, and refine them using your own expertise and judgment.  

2. Verify and Cross-Check AI Results  
   Always confirm AI-generated information with trusted sources or through hands-on testing.  

3. Maintain and Practice Core Skills  
   Continue honing your research, design, and critical thinking abilities so you can work effectively without AI support.  

4. Limit AI Use in High-Stakes Decisions  
   For sensitive, complex, or high-impact tasks, rely on your own professional knowledge and involve team reviews.  

5. Reflect on the Process  
   Regularly assess whether AI is helping you think better or making you think less, and adjust your usage accordingly.

## What Steps Will You Take to Ensure Data Privacy When Using AI Tools?

1. Avoid Entering Sensitive or Confidential Data  
   Never input company secrets, client information, personal identifiers, or security credentials into AI tools.  

2. Use Company-Approved AI Platforms  
   Prefer AI tools that have been vetted and approved by the organisation for security and compliance.  

3. Anonymise Information Before Input  
   Replace real names, IDs, and other identifiable details with generic placeholders when discussing real cases.  

4. Review AI Tool Privacy Policies  
   Understand how the tool stores, processes, and uses your data before uploading any content.  

5. Limit AI Use for Internal or High-Risk Projects  
   Avoid using public AI tools for work involving highly sensitive or regulated information.
   
## Specific Task Example at Focus Bear – Using AI in Practice

During my internship at Focus Bear, I used ChatGPT to help **convert a usability test conversation with a friend into a structured, professional usability report**.

**Task example:**  
I invited a friend, who regularly uses the Focus Keeper app, to test the Focus Session feature in the Focus Bear iPhone app. The session was an informal conversation where she shared feedback on the onboarding flow, pointing out redundancies, unclear UI elements, and extra steps in starting and ending a session. My goal was to turn this unstructured conversation into a formal report for internal review.

**How I used the AI tool:**  
- Removed personal details and sensitive app data from the conversation notes.  
- Provided the cleaned text to ChatGPT with instructions to:  
  1. Identify key usability issues from the conversation.  
  2. Organise them into a clear “Issue – Why – Suggested Fix” structure.  
  3. Keep the language concise and aligned with Focus Bear’s UX style.  

**AI output quality:**  
The AI produced a well-organised draft that grouped related issues together and suggested possible improvements, saving significant formatting and rewriting time.

**Edits and fact-checking:**  
I compared the AI’s draft against the original conversation to ensure accuracy, replaced generic terms with exact UI labels from the Focus Bear app, and corrected any minor inaccuracies. I also removed any suggestions not supported by the actual feedback.

**Personal best practice:**  
When using AI to process usability test feedback, I always anonymise the data, provide clear formatting instructions, and fact-check every output against the original source before sharing it with the team.
