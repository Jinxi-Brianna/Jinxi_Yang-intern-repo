# Developer Feedback - Onboarding / Time Setting

## Summary
Developers reviewed the previous popup design and suggested simplifying it to a consistent full-screen layout to align with the rest of the onboarding sequence.

## Feedback
- **Popup replaced:** Recommended removing the modal and using the standard full-screen format.
- **Implementation:** Using the existing onboarding template improves consistency and reduces code complexity.
- **Copy:** The conversational tone ("Yes - my phone wrecks my sleep!") approved.
- **Transition:** Simple forward navigation between the two screens is sufficient.

## Changes Made
- Removed popup overlay design.
- Converted both screens to full-screen format.
- Updated titles and button copy.
- Verified color and text styles match global tokens.
- Confirmed component reuse (buttons and time picker).

## Final Status
Design updated based on developer feedback.  
No further changes required â€” file ready for build.
