## Reflection – Professionalism and Working with Supervisors

### 1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
Yes, I have experienced great teamwork when everyone was clear about their roles, communicated openly, and respected each other’s time and ideas. It was effective because the team shared updates regularly, addressed issues early, and offered constructive feedback that focused on solutions rather than blame.

### 2. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
I will use simple and direct language, avoid jargon, and confirm understanding in writing when needed. I will be mindful of tone, especially in written messages, and listen actively to others’ perspectives. I will also aim to make space for everyone’s input, respecting different communication and working styles.

### 3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
I will balance being friendly and approachable with being reliable and accountable. I will celebrate team achievements, show appreciation for others’ contributions, and maintain a respectful attitude even in stressful situations. I will also keep humour light and inclusive so that everyone feels comfortable.

### 4. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
I will review relevant project documents in advance, prepare questions or updates, and have a clear meeting agenda. I will also bring any necessary materials or examples to make discussions more productive, and ensure I am ready to give concise, relevant updates on my work.

### 5. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
Being proactive means providing progress updates without being asked, starting on new tasks promptly, and addressing potential blockers early. It also means seeking clarification before problems grow and looking for ways to contribute beyond my assigned tasks when possible.

### 6. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
I will follow up politely through the original communication channel first. If there is no response within the expected timeframe, I will escalate based on urgency — for example, moving from email to chat, and then to a call if it is urgent. I will escalate only when necessary and always explain why it is urgent.

### 7. What are some things you won't do?
I will not wait passively for instructions without taking initiative. I will not come to meetings unprepared or ignore feedback. I will avoid using only one communication method for urgent matters, and I will not speak disrespectfully or dismissively to colleagues, even under pressure.
