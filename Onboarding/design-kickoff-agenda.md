# Design Kickoff Agenda - Onboarding / Time Setting Redesign

## Purpose
Prepare for the implementation of the updated onboarding Time Setting flow and ensure the design handoff file is clear and ready for development.

## Context
This kickoff was conducted to review the redesign of the Time Setting section, which changes the old popup format to a consistent full-screen layout.

## Goals
1. Present the updated design and its purpose.  
2. Review logic between the two screens (“Tech Curfew” → “Time Picker”).  
3. Confirm that styles and components follow existing design tokens.  
4. Identify potential implementation questions or unknowns before build.  
5. Finalize the handoff file for development.

## Agenda
| Step | Topic |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Overview of redesign goals |
| 2 | Walkthrough of the Figma flow |
| 3 | Review of interactions and transitions |
| 4 | Check component reuse and consistency |
| 5 | List follow-up actions or documentation updates |

## Key Topics
- Why the popup version was replaced with a full-screen layout.  
- How the “Yes / No thanks” logic connects to the next onboarding step.  
- Use of the existing button and time picker components.  
- Consistency with other onboarding steps (Goals → Routine → Timing).  

## Expected Outcome
- All redesign intentions documented in Figma comments.  
- Clear structure and logic ready for handoff.  
- No unresolved design questions before build.
