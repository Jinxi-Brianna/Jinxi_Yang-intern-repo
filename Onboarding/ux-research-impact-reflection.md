## Reflection

### 1. If research contradicts a designer’s personal preference, what should happen?
When research findings conflict with a designer’s personal preference, the decision should be guided by evidence rather than taste. UX design is about serving user needs, not matching individual aesthetic choices. If user testing shows that a preferred visual style or interaction pattern causes confusion, increases task time, or reduces accessibility, the designer should adapt the design to match what works best for the target audience. For Focus Bear, this might mean choosing a higher-contrast color scheme over a subtle palette if it helps ADHD users locate key buttons faster, even if the designer prefers the subtler look.

### 2. How can UX designers ensure that their work aligns with real user needs?
UX designers can align their work with real user needs by grounding decisions in continuous research and feedback loops. This includes conducting usability tests, gathering both quantitative data (task completion rates, time on task) and qualitative insights (user interviews, open-ended surveys), and iterating based on findings. It’s also important to involve diverse users, especially neurodivergent participants, early and often in the process. In Focus Bear’s case, designers might test the onboarding flow with ADHD users to verify that the instructions are clear and the number of steps feels manageable.

### 3. What risks come with relying on assumptions rather than research when designing an interface?
Relying on assumptions can lead to features that are difficult to use, irrelevant, or even frustrating for the target audience. Assumptions may be based on the designer’s own habits or experiences, which often don’t match those of real users — especially when designing for neurodivergent groups. This can result in wasted development time, low adoption rates, and negative user sentiment. For Focus Bear, assuming that all users understand the purpose of the “Brain Dump” feature — without testing or explaining it — could result in some users ignoring it entirely. They might not realise that their notes can later be used as AI input to generate a personalised plan, which means they miss out on one of the app’s valuable productivity benefits.
