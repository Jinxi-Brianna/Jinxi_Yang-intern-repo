## Reflection

### 1. What is the difference between personal opinion and objective UX critique?
Personal opinion is based on individual taste or style preference (e.g., “I like this color because it’s my favorite”), while objective UX critique is grounded in usability, accessibility, and alignment with design goals. In Focus Bear’s context, an objective critique would reference how a design choice supports neurodivergent users — for example, saying “This button color doesn’t meet contrast guidelines and may be hard for ADHD users to notice” is objective, because it connects to a usability standard and user need.

### 2. If someone gives vague feedback like "I don’t like this", how would you get more useful input?
I would ask follow-up questions to uncover the reason behind their reaction, such as: “Can you tell me what about it feels off to you?” or “Is there something that makes it harder to use or understand?” I’d also guide them to frame their thoughts in terms of user goals or usability impact — for example, whether the issue is about readability, navigation clarity, or visual hierarchy. This turns a vague reaction into actionable feedback that can guide design improvements.

### 3. How can you ensure that design critique sessions are productive rather than overwhelming?
To keep critique sessions productive, I would set a clear agenda and scope, for example, focusing on one feature or flow at a time. I’d also encourage feedback to be specific, related to design goals, and limited to a manageable number of points per session. If there are too many suggestions, we can prioritise them based on impact and feasibility. In Focus Bear’s case, a critique session might focus only on the focus session timer interface for one meeting, rather than trying to cover the entire app, to avoid overloading the discussion.
