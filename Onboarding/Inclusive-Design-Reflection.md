## How Can You Adjust Your Communication Style to Be More Inclusive of Neurodivergent Users and Teammates?

To better include neurodivergent users and teammates in my work, I can adjust my communication style in the following ways:

1. **Use Clear and Direct Language**  
   - Avoid vague terms and complex jargon.  
   - Break down instructions into smaller, actionable steps.  
   - Confirm understanding by summarising key points in writing.  

2. **Prefer Written Follow-Ups**  
   - After verbal discussions, provide a brief written recap so details are not lost.  
   - Use bullet points and headings for clarity.  

3. **Be Mindful of Processing Time**  
   - Give teammates time to process ideas before expecting a response.  
   - Share meeting agendas and design drafts in advance.  

4. **Provide Multiple Communication Options**  
   - Offer both synchronous (meetings, calls) and asynchronous (email, chat) channels.  
   - Allow teammates to choose the method that works best for them.  

5. **Use a Supportive and Non-Judgmental Tone**  
   - Focus feedback on the work, not the person.  
   - Frame suggestions constructively and encourage open dialogue.

## What Are Some Common UX or Communication Pitfalls That Might Make Focus Bear Less Accessible or Supportive?

1. **Overly Complex Navigation**  
   - Multiple layers of menus or unclear button labels can overwhelm users with ADHD or Autism, making it harder to complete tasks.  

2. **Excessive Visual or Audio Stimuli**  
   - Flashing animations, autoplay sounds, or overly bright colour schemes can trigger sensory overload for neurodivergent users.  

3. **Lack of Predictability**  
   - Sudden layout changes, unexpected pop-ups, or inconsistent button placement can increase cognitive load and reduce trust.  

4. **Too Much Information at Once**  
   - Presenting long instructions or crowded screens without visual hierarchy can make it hard for users to process and focus.  

5. **Judgmental or Discouraging Messaging**  
   - Notifications or prompts that imply failure (“You didn’t meet your goal again”) can reduce motivation and increase frustration.  

6. **Limited Personalisation Options**  
   - Not allowing users to adjust pacing, turn off certain notifications, or choose a calmer theme may prevent them from tailoring the experience to their needs.

## What Is One Practical Change You Can Make in Your Work to Better Support Vulnerable Populations?

One practical change I can make in my work is to consistently present key information in multiple formats, combining short, plain-language text with clear visual aids such as icons, diagrams, or step-by-step screenshots. This approach reduces cognitive load for users with ADHD or Autism by making information easier to process, while also supporting different learning preferences and improving clarity for all users, including those with lower digital literacy or non-native English speakers. By applying this practice across my wireframes, prototypes, and final designs, I can create a more inclusive and accessible experience that empowers vulnerable populations to engage with Focus Bear confidently and effectively.
