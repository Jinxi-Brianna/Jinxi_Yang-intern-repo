# Agile Roles – Reflection

## What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

As a UX Designer Intern at Focus Bear, my role focuses on improving the usability and accessibility of the app through user-centered design. I contribute to the Agile process by working on real features — designing wireframes, building interactive prototypes in Figma, and conducting user testing to validate and refine ideas.

My work fits into the early stages of the Agile cycle. By turning vague ideas or feature requests into clear, testable designs, I help reduce uncertainty for both the product manager and the developers. Well-prepared design assets and feedback loops also help the team avoid rework later on and align design decisions with both user needs and business goals.

Even though I’m still in the onboarding phase, I’ve already started reflecting my design progress through the Kanban board, which helps others understand what I’m working on and when to get involved.

## How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

In this internship, I work closely with a cross-functional team that includes one product manager, two developers, a UI designer, and my UX mentor.

- I collaborate with the **product manager** to understand feature priorities and the reasoning behind them. This helps me make sure my designs address the right problems.
- I interact with **developers** to ensure the designs are feasible and aligned with technical constraints. I often share Figma files, clarify interactions, and respond to build-related questions.
- I also share a boundary with the **UI designer**, making sure the final designs follow the visual system while staying focused on usability.
- My mentor supports me in design reviews and helps me improve my design decisions through regular feedback.

These interactions are essential to working in an Agile team — designs are not handed off in isolation, but constantly shaped by input from others. Being able to communicate design intent clearly, give context, and stay open to changes is a big part of how my role fits into the team.

##  Task 1 – My Role in the Agile Team

As a UX design intern, I support the Agile team by turning ideas into usable and testable designs. I create wireframes, build Figma prototypes, and help collect user feedback to improve the product. My work provides the design foundation developers and QA can use to build and verify features. I also keep my design tasks updated on the Kanban board, so the team can stay informed about progress.

##  Task 2 – Collaborating with My UX Mentor

I work most closely with my UX mentor, who reviews my designs and gives feedback. To improve our collaboration, I plan to share my drafts earlier and check in more regularly instead of waiting for weekly meetings. This way, I can get quicker feedback, fix issues faster, and stay more aligned with the overall design direction.

I also want to improve by communicating more actively — not just to update progress, but to ask questions, explain my thinking, and learn from her experience. The more I engage in conversation, the more I can grow as a designer and better support the team.
