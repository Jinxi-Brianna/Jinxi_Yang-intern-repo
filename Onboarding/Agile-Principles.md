# Agile – Reflection

## What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

One of the biggest benefits of Agile is its flexibility and transparency. The team can adapt quickly to changes, deliver small usable pieces frequently, and get feedback earlier. This reduces the risk of rework and helps us catch issues early. Tools like Kanban boards also make it easy to see who’s working on what, which keeps everyone on the same page.

However, Agile also comes with challenges. It requires frequent communication and active participation from everyone, which can be difficult for new team members who are still learning the workflow. Without clear priorities, flexibility can sometimes lead to confusion. Agile only works well when the team shares responsibility and stays aligned.

## How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

As a UX design intern, I find that Agile principles really support my role. Since Agile encourages early testing and continuous iteration, I don’t have to wait until designs are “perfect” — I can share wireframes or prototypes early, get feedback, and improve them over time.

Agile also emphasizes collaboration and visibility. I can work closely with the product manager, developers, and my mentor to make sure design ideas are realistic and aligned with user needs. It also encourages me to keep my design tasks updated on the Kanban board and communicate clearly so others understand where things stand.

Going forward, I plan to share my drafts earlier, add useful notes to task cards, and ask for feedback more often. This will help me stay aligned with the team and improve my designs more efficiently.


## Task
### 1. Main Differences Between Scrum and Kanban

Scrum is based on fixed-length sprints, usually lasting 1–2 weeks. The team plans all tasks at the beginning of the sprint and reviews progress at the end. Roles like Product Owner and Scrum Master are clearly defined, and there are regular meetings such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.

Kanban, on the other hand, is more flexible. There are no set sprints — tasks flow continuously, and team members pull in new work when ready. Work is visualized on a board, and limits are set on how many tasks can be in progress at once (WIP limits). There are fewer required meetings, and roles are more fluid.

In short:  
- **Scrum** = structured, sprint-based, fixed planning cycles  
- **Kanban** = continuous, flexible, and flow-based

### 2. One Agile Principle That’s Most Useful in My Work

The Agile principle I find most useful is:  
**“Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.”**

As a UX design intern, I often have to revise wireframes or prototypes based on user feedback or team discussions. This principle reminds me that change is part of the process, not something to avoid. Staying flexible allows me to improve designs and better meet user needs without feeling like I’ve failed just because something has to be redone.
