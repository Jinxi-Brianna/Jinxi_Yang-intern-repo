## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

Focus Bear was created from the lived experience of its founder, Jeremy Nagel, who is an AuDHDer (autistic + ADHD). Despite his best intentions, his well‑planned morning routine often fell apart, turning into sleepily checking emails and scrolling instead of completing planned activities like yoga. To address this, he tried using parental control apps, hiding his laptop in a cupboard, and even asking his wife to intervene if he was online in the mornings. None of these strategies worked consistently.

From my perspective, this is very relatable. In my country, ADHD is often not well recognised or taken seriously. Many people may live with ADHD‑like symptoms for years without a diagnosis, only starting to think about it recently as social media brings more awareness. I have also seen that even people without a formal diagnosis face similar difficulties. The constant flow of fragmented information, such as short‑form videos, has made it harder for them to stay focused, keep track of time, and follow through on commitments. For both diagnosed ADHD individuals and others struggling with attention and procrastination, Focus Bear offers a structured system that combines effective features from different productivity tools to help build and maintain healthy habits.

## What problem is Focus Bear solving?

Focus Bear addresses core challenges faced by people with ADHD and other forms of neurodivergence: sustaining focus, managing time effectively, and smoothly transitioning between tasks. Without effective support, these challenges can lead to missed routines, unproductive stretches, chronic lateness, and difficulty meeting deadlines. The app helps by providing continuous, structured support throughout the day, such as smart break reminders that detect hyperfocus, punctuality alerts that escalate in intensity, and distraction blocking that works across all devices.

From my own observation, these problems are not limited to people with a formal ADHD diagnosis. In today’s world, even many “ordinary” people — especially those overwhelmed by fragmented digital input like TikTok‑style short videos — are finding it harder to concentrate for extended periods. Self‑discipline is also becoming harder to maintain, and procrastination is a common struggle. I believe Focus Bear could also be valuable for these people, as it offers the same structured guidance and distraction‑free environment that can help them stay on track and meet their deadlines.

## Why do you think this mission is important?

I think this mission is important because people with ADHD and other forms of neurodivergence often face challenges that are invisible to others but greatly affect their daily lives. Difficulties with time management, sustaining focus, and following routines can lead to missed deadlines, lateness, and a constant feeling of being behind, even when they are trying their best. These struggles can lower confidence and create unnecessary stress.

I have a close friend with ADHD who has almost no sense of time. She may believe that only five minutes have passed when in reality forty minutes are gone. When we talk, she can suddenly get distracted by something else and leave the conversation. At first, I thought she was being rude, but I later understood that it was her ADHD. She often sets out to do one thing but gets pulled away by other tasks along the way, which causes her to be late, forget appointments, and miss deadlines. I believe Focus Bear’s mission is valuable because it provides tools and guidance that can help people like her stay aware of time, manage distractions, and complete the tasks they planned to do.

## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

I have always been interested in ways to improve focus and manage time better, partly because I often struggle with procrastination and find it hard to stay concentrated for long. This makes me curious about tools and methods that can actually make a difference in daily life.

Focus Bear’s work matches my interests because it takes a practical approach to solving these problems. It doesn’t just talk about productivity — it builds systems that help people stick to their routines and block out distractions. I find it meaningful to be part of something that can help both myself and others work more effectively and feel more in control of their time.

## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, I relate to many of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve. I often struggle with self‑control and have a strong urge to check social media, even when I know I should be focusing on my work. Once I start scrolling, it’s easy to lose track of time, and what feels like a few minutes can quickly turn into much longer. I also get distracted easily — I might begin one task, notice something else, and end up switching tasks without finishing the first one.

These habits often break my flow and make it harder to complete things on time. I want to build better focus and time‑management habits, and I’m interested in how Focus Bear’s approach could help me stay present and follow through more consistently in my daily life.
