## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I want to see how different roles work together to turn ideas into real features and how design decisions are made in a team. I’m also interested in learning how user needs are translated into design solutions and how feedback is incorporated effectively.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?
I’m most excited to develop my Figma skills so I can create and iterate on designs more efficiently. I also want to strengthen my UX thinking — learning to design with both the user experience and business needs in mind. In addition, I hope to improve my ability to communicate design ideas clearly to both designers and non‑designers.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I can bring fresh perspectives as someone who is eager to learn and is observant about user experiences. I’m detail‑oriented and willing to take initiative in exploring solutions. I can also contribute by documenting processes, sharing feedback during design discussions, and helping with tasks that require careful attention to detail.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I feel less confident in collaborative design workflows. I sometimes struggle to integrate my ideas smoothly with others’ work, especially when working in a shared design file or making changes as a group. I’d like to become more comfortable working in this collaborative setting and learn best practices for team‑based design projects.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
For me, success means completing the internship with a stronger set of UX design skills, especially in Figma and collaborative workflows. It also means having a clear picture of the product development process and feeling more confident contributing to team projects. Ultimately, I want to leave the internship knowing I’ve added value to the team while growing into a more capable and confident UX designer.
