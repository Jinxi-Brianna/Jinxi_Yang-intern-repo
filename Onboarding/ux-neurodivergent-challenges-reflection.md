## Reflection

### 1. How can Focus Bear’s design choices make tasks easier for neurodivergent users?  
Focus Bear can help neurodivergent users by making each step in the app simple and predictable.  

- **During focus sessions**: only show the current task name, a countdown timer, and one clear button to pause or end — this prevents distractions and makes it obvious what to do next.  
- **During breaks**: show one habit card at a time (e.g., “55s Office Stretch”) with the same layout every time, so users don’t need to re-learn the screen.  
- **In habit tracking**: keep the list short, use progress bars to show how much is done, and mark items as complete automatically when possible.  

These choices reduce the amount of thinking needed, lower the chance of getting distracted, and help users finish tasks more easily.

### 2. If a feature is technically useful but cognitively overwhelming, how should it be redesigned?  
The feature should be broken into smaller, progressive steps and introduced gradually through **progressive disclosure**.  
- Instead of exposing all settings or options at once, the default state should work “out of the box” with sensible presets, while advanced configurations are tucked behind an **Advanced Settings** toggle.  
- Visual density can be reduced by grouping related elements, using plain-language labels, and removing non-essential decorative elements.  

**Example**: If the “Break Habits” feature offers multiple habit types, durations, and triggers, the initial setup could simply ask, *“Would you like a short movement break?”* and let users customize details later.

### 3. What are some small UX adjustments that can significantly improve user experience for neurodivergent users?  
Small, low-effort adjustments can make a big difference, such as:  
- **Dual-format time display**: show both a progress ring and “mm:ss” countdown to avoid mental conversion.  
- **Reduced-motion mode**: offer a toggle to disable animations that may cause sensory overload.  
- **Clear action labels**: replace vague labels (“Optimize”) with explicit ones (“Block social media during focus”).  
- **Consistent habit cards**: same layout, button placement, and duration indicator across all break activities.  
- **Silent notification summary**: batch non-urgent alerts and present them after a focus session ends.  

These tweaks enhance clarity, reduce cognitive strain, and help users stay engaged without feeling overwhelmed.

### 4. What are some real-world design examples that improve accessibility for neurodivergent users?  
- **Apple iOS Focus Mode**: allows users to silence non-essential notifications, customize allowed apps, and set different modes for work, personal time, or sleep.  
- **Microsoft Word Focus Mode**: hides all toolbars and menus so the user can concentrate solely on the document content.
