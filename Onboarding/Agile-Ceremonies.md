How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Agile ceremonies provide regular, structured opportunities for team members to share progress, raise blockers, and stay aligned on goals. For example, daily stand-ups ensure that everyone knows what others are working on, and can identify dependencies or delays early. Sprint planning helps the whole team agree on whatâ€™s achievable, while retrospectives give space to reflect and improve team collaboration. These ceremonies reduce misunderstandings and keep the team moving in the same direction.

Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

For my role as a UX designer intern, I think retrospectives are the most valuable ceremony. They create a safe space to hear feedback on how the team is working together, including how designs are received, handed off, or implemented. As someone learning how to collaborate across roles, retrospectives help me reflect on my contribution and understand how to better support the team in the next iteration.
