### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Agile ceremonies provide regular, structured opportunities for team members to share progress, raise blockers, and stay aligned on goals. For example, daily stand-ups ensure that everyone knows what others are working on, and can identify dependencies or delays early. Sprint planning helps the whole team agree on what’s achievable, while retrospectives give space to reflect and improve team collaboration. These ceremonies reduce misunderstandings and keep the team moving in the same direction.

### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

For my role as a UX designer intern, I think retrospectives are the most valuable ceremony. They create a safe space to hear feedback on how the team is working together, including how designs are received, handed off, or implemented. As someone learning how to collaborate across roles, retrospectives help me reflect on my contribution and understand how to better support the team in the next iteration.

## Personal Participation Record

### Meeting – 2025-08-11 at 9:30 AM
Attended the weekly UX team meeting. I was assigned the task of reviewing the user onboarding process to identify pain points. I also shared last week’s progress, completing a set of usability observations, and synced with the team on current priorities.

### Retrospective Insight
From the most recent retrospective notes, I found it interesting how the team reached consensus on the schedule screen design. We decided to adopt Option 2 — collapsed blocks with in-place expansion — to reduce visual overwhelm, while keeping the current/active routine block expanded by default. I learned how small interface adjustments, like adding clear dropdown indicators, can balance simplicity with usability and make it easier for users to focus on their immediate tasks.


### My Collaboration Improvement Action
I will start documenting onboarding usability issues directly in GitHub issues, including annotated screenshots and clear acceptance criteria, so the development team can address them efficiently.
