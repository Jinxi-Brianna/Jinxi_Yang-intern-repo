## Agile Workflows & Kanban – Reflection

## How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban helps manage priorities and avoid overload by making the workflow visual and applying Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits.

- Each task is represented as a card and moves through columns such as “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done,” allowing the team to see what’s most important at a glance.
- WIP limits prevent individuals or teams from juggling too many tasks at once, reducing the risk of delays, mistakes, or burnout.
- If a column becomes overcrowded (e.g., “Review” or “QA”), it signals a bottleneck, prompting the team to pause and resolve the issue.

This focus on completing tasks before starting new ones helps maintain team clarity, reduce stress, and improve delivery speed.

## How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

I can improve my workflow by applying several key Kanban principles:

1. **Break large tasks into smaller stages**  
   I’ll split complex tasks into more manageable subtasks and track them through clear stages like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.”

2. **Limit work in progress**  
   By restricting myself to working on only 1–2 tasks at a time, I can stay focused, reduce context switching, and finish work more efficiently.

3. **Update task status in real time**  
   I’ll regularly move tasks between columns as I progress to ensure transparency and keep team members informed.

4. **Review the board weekly**  
   I’ll reflect on any blocked or delayed tasks, identify what went wrong, and adjust my planning in future weeks to improve flow.

By incorporating these habits, I can avoid overload, boost my productivity, and improve team communication.

## Task Tracking:

## 1. Checked Focus bear's Kanban board
I reviewed the full Kanban board on GitHub used by the Focus Bear team. It’s clearly organized into columns that represent different stages of the workflow, and you can tell at a glance where each task is in the process.

For example, I noticed columns like:

- **Ready for QA** – tasks that are finished and waiting to be tested  
- **QA in Progress** – tasks currently being tested  
- **For Dev QA** – tasks that require developer action after QA feedback  
- **QA Passed/Done** – tasks that have passed testing and are completed

## 2. Moved a task through the Kanban process

I selected one onboarding-related task from my personal repository

- Started in **“To Do”**
- Moved to **“In Progress”** while I was working on the reflection
- Marked as **“Done”** once the writing was complete

This gave me hands-on experience with how Kanban reflects real-time task status and makes progress visible not just to myself but to others who may be reviewing my work.

## 3. One way I can improve task tracking in my UX role

As a UX intern, one thing I can improve is how I keep others in the loop during the in-between stages — especially when I'm working on something that's not immediately visible, like research notes or early design drafts.

Sometimes I might make progress (like collecting user feedback or updating a Figma prototype) but forget to reflect that in the Kanban board. This can make it hard for developers or project managers to know whether the task is actually moving forward.

To improve this, I plan to update the task status more regularly — even if the work is still in progress — and add short notes in the card if helpful. For example, I might write “initial wireframes done – pending feedback from mentor” instead of waiting until everything is final. That way, the team has a clearer picture of what’s going on, and it also invites earlier input, which helps avoid misalignment later.
