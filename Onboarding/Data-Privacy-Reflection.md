## Reflection – Data Privacy & Confidentiality

### 1. What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?
I will follow the principle of least privilege, only accessing data necessary for my work. I will always use secure, company-approved tools for storing and processing information, and ensure all sensitive data is encrypted both in storage and during transmission. I will avoid accessing confidential information on public or unsecured networks, and will lock my devices when unattended. I will also stay informed about Focus Bear’s privacy policies and best practices to make sure I am consistently following them.

### 2. How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
Sensitive information should be stored in secure, access-controlled systems approved by the company, with encryption enabled. When sharing confidential data internally, I will confirm the recipient has the necessary access rights and use secure channels, avoiding personal devices or unapproved platforms. When disposing of sensitive information, I will permanently delete files from all storage locations, including backups, and ensure any physical documents are shredded rather than discarded in regular trash.

### 3. What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?
Common mistakes include storing confidential data on personal devices, sharing sensitive information over unsecured channels, failing to encrypt data, and discussing private information in public or unsecured spaces. These issues can be avoided by always using secure, company-approved systems, enabling encryption, verifying recipient permissions before sharing, and being mindful of surroundings when handling confidential data. Regular training and awareness can also help prevent accidental disclosures.

### Habit or Practice to Improve Data Security
I will make it a habit to always use secure, company-approved tools and encrypted channels when storing or sharing sensitive information, rather than using personal accounts or unsecured apps.

### Key Learning / Security Measure
I will lock my computer whenever I step away from my desk to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive information.
