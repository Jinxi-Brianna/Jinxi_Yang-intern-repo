## Reflection

1. **If a developer tells you a design is too complex to implement, how would you respond?**  
   I would start by understanding the specific challenges—whether they are related to performance, compatibility, time constraints, or technical limitations. Then, I would work collaboratively with the developer to explore alternative approaches that preserve the core user experience while simplifying implementation. For example, we could break the feature into phases, starting with an MVP version and adding more advanced elements later once resources allow.

2. **What are some non-visual factors (e.g., performance, accessibility, load time) that can impact a UX design?**  
   Non-visual factors include:  
   - **Performance** – Slow animations or high memory usage can frustrate users and reduce engagement.  
   - **Accessibility** – Lack of screen reader support or poor color contrast can exclude users with disabilities.  
   - **Load time** – Long loading delays can increase drop-off rates, especially on mobile or slower networks.  
   - **Security & privacy** – Compliance requirements may limit how features are designed or displayed.  
   - **Device compatibility** – Some interactions may not work smoothly on all devices or browsers.

3. **How can UX designers help find middle-ground solutions between ideal design and technical feasibility?**  
   UX designers can work closely with developers and PMs to prioritize user needs and identify which parts of the design are non-negotiable for usability. They can suggest simplified versions of complex elements, use progressive enhancement, or adjust interaction patterns to fit technical constraints. By focusing on delivering the most critical features first and iterating over time, designers can maintain both usability and development feasibility.
