### Reflection

1. **If a PM tells you there’s no time for a UX improvement, how would you respond?**  
I would first seek to understand the constraints and priorities behind the decision, then present the UX improvement in terms of its potential impact on key product or business goals. If timing is the issue, I could propose a phased approach, suggest a simplified version that fits within the current sprint, or add the improvement to the backlog with clear justification. The goal is to keep the idea alive for future consideration rather than dropping it entirely.

2. **How can UX designers ensure that important usability issues don’t get ignored?**  
UX designers can maintain visibility of usability issues by documenting them clearly, including evidence such as user testing videos, metrics, and user quotes. Regularly reviewing these issues with PMs and developers during planning sessions helps keep them on the radar. Assigning severity levels and linking them to potential business impact (e.g., increased churn, lower conversion) can make it harder to overlook critical problems.

3. **What’s the best way to present UX work as a business priority rather than a "nice-to-have"?**  
To position UX work as a business priority, it should be framed in terms of measurable outcomes such as higher conversion rates, better retention, or reduced support costs. For example, showing that clarifying the “Brain Dump” feature in onboarding could increase new-user activation rates makes the improvement directly relevant to product adoption and long-term growth.
