# UX Prioritization Reflection

## 1. If a PM tells you there’s no time for a UX improvement, how would you respond?

I would first seek to understand the constraints and priorities behind the decision, then present the UX improvement in terms of its potential impact on key product or business goals. If timing is the issue, I could propose a phased approach, suggest a simplified version that fits within the current sprint, or add the improvement to the backlog with clear justification. The goal is to keep the idea alive for future consideration rather than dropping it entirely.

## 2. How can UX designers ensure that important usability issues don’t get ignored?

UX designers can maintain visibility of usability issues by documenting them clearly, including evidence such as user testing videos, metrics, and user quotes. Regularly reviewing these issues with PMs and developers during planning sessions helps keep them on the radar. Assigning severity levels and linking them to potential business impact (e.g., increased churn, lower conversion) can make it harder to overlook critical problems.

UX designers can ensure important usability issues aren’t overlooked by clearly documenting the problem, providing supporting evidence, and connecting the issue to product goals or user experience impact. This includes using user quotes, session recordings, and screenshots, as well as identifying the severity and potential consequences.

For example, during testing, I discovered that the “Reflect on the session” button on the Focus Bear session completion screen was often missed — including by myself. The button was placed low on the screen with minimal visual emphasis, and there was no prompt to guide users. I only realised its purpose after noticing that my achievements were blank in the Focus Stats and going back to investigate. This meant a key part of the app’s value — reinforcing goal completion and tracking achievements — was being skipped without users even realising it.

I documented the issue with a screenshot and clearly described the pain point and its broader impact on motivation and habit tracking. Based on this, I proposed a redesign to bring the reflection prompt higher on the screen, increase visual contrast, and include a short explanation of why reflection matters. I then created a new layout in Figma and shared it with the team for feedback.

By taking initiative to not only report but also redesign the flow, I helped ensure the issue was taken seriously and moved closer to implementation.

## 3. What’s the best way to present UX work as a business priority rather than a "nice-to-have"?

To position UX work as a business priority, it should be framed in terms of measurable outcomes such as higher conversion rates, better retention, or reduced support costs. For example, showing that clarifying the “Brain Dump” feature in onboarding could increase new-user activation rates makes the improvement directly relevant to product adoption and long-term growth.
